                <p>When you get stuck, remember 'impossible' can be split to be 'I'm possible' and 'can't' has a good amount of 'can' in it.</p>
                <p>These challenges are not only meant to challenge you, but to give you a bit on inspiration on what you can do with your new programming skills. Try to put your own spin on things!</p>

                    Restaurant's website (from Magnus Chase). Some real world restaurant sites include  <a href = "https://www.olivegarden.com/home">Olive Garden</a> and

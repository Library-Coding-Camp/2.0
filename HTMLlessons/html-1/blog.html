                <h2 id = "big-header">Building a blog using HTML</h2>
                <p>Hello everyone! Today I am going to be teaching you how to build a blog using just HTML. HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language and is
                used for laying out elements on a webpage. Today, we will make this webpage: </p>

                <img src = "">

                <h3 id = "setup">Setting Up your work enviornment</h3>

                <p> Its time to set up where we will be coding. There are many IDE's (integrated development enviornments) you can use. For this
                example I will be using replit, a free online ide (see replit.com). </p>
                <p class = "new-word">IDE = Integrated Development Environment. It is a "software for building applications that combines common developer 
                tools into a single graphical user interface (GUI)" <br> ~Definition taken from Red Hat at 
                <a href = "https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/middleware/what-is-ide">redhat.com</a></p>

                <p>If you are going to use replit to create your Blog, keep in
                mind all of it will be public, so anyone can view your code. (As a result, I suggest not using your real name while creating your account.)
                If you would like to create a private project, try using a desktop IDE, such as Visual Studio Code. or Atom. You can find installation and project
                setup information <a href = "https://atom.io/">HERE for Atom</a> and <a href = "https://code.visualstudio.com/"> HERE for Visual Studio Code. </a> </p>

                <p>On with the show.</p>

                <p>To set up your new project in replit, go to your replit homepage and click " + new repl". Then in the popup, select HTML,CSS Javascript
                from the languages list and give your project a name. At last, click 'Create repl'.</p>

                <video autoplay muted loop>
                    <source src="media/makefiles.mov" >
                </video>

                <p>Your IDE is now all ready. Time to start with the HTML!</p>
            
                <h3 id = "starterCode" >Dissecting the Starter Code</h3>
                <p>Lets take a look at the replit workspace. We have our files on the left, our code area in the middle, and our website preview 
                on the right. Beneath the website preview is the console (the dark box). You are welcome to minimize it, as we will not be using 
                the console in today's lesson. </p>

                <p> You should be on the file titled index.html. In this file, we see that replit has provided us with some starter code. on the first line
                of our starter code we see 	<span class = "code"> &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; </span>. This simply warns/tells the browser that we are
                working in HTML and that this is an HTML document. Going to the next line, we see: <span class = "code">&lt;html&gt;</span>. This is
                called the html tag. In between <span class = "code">&lt;html&gt;</span> and <span class = "code">&lt;/html&gt;</span> (which you will find at
                the end of the document) tags is where all the HTML will be (except for the  <span class = "code"> &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; </span>).</p>
                

                <p class = "new-word">An HTML tag. HTML consists of tags. These tags go on the either side of your text content (the text your want on your webpage) 
                and help style that text. </p>

                <p>The line after that contains the head tag. (<span class = "code">&lt;head&gt;</span>). Basically, the content enclosed in the html tag is 
                divided into 2 sections, the head and the body.</p>
                
                <img src = "media/dissectingTags.png">

                <p class = "new-word"> You may have noticed that the HTML tags I'm talking about have this format: <span class = "code"> &lt;TagName&gt;</span>
                and <span class = "code">&lt;/TagName&gt;</span>. The only difference between the two tags is that the one with the backslach is a closing tag and
                the one without the backslash is a closing tag. Together, the opening tag, what is between the opening and closing tag, and the closing tag make up 
                an html element. There will be more on HTML tags later.</p>

                <p>Inside the head tag we see the HTML, <span class="code">&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;</span> This basically tells the browser (where your html
                code will be running) to use the UTF-8 charecter encoding. UTF-8 charecter encoding is used to take the 'machine-text' and turn it into something
                people can read. You can learn more about UTF-8 <a href = "https://bitsofco.de/meta-charset/">HERE.</a></p>

                <p> The next line of code in the head tag is the <span class="code">&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width"&gt;</span>. This gives the browser
                that your html will be running on direction for how to scale your website.</p>
                <p>The next line of code in the head is the title tag. The text inbetween the opening and closing tag title tag (<span class = "code"> &lt;title&gt; </span>
                and <span class = "code">&lt;/title&gt;</span>) determines what the tab your page is on says. You can change the text inbetween the opening and closing
                tag to have the title of your tab be different. </p>

                <video autoplay muted loop>
                    <source src="media/titleTag.mov">
                </video>

                <p>The next line of the code is <span class = "code"> &lt;link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" /&gt;</span> Feel free to delete this line of 
                code. This line of code connects HTML to CSS, but since we will not be dealing with CSS in this lesson the link to the CSS file is irrelevant.</p>

                <p>The next line consists of the opening body tag (<span class = "code">&lt;body&gt;</span>). This just means that the code after the opening body tag and before
                the closing body tag is in the body of the HTML document.</p>

                <p class = "new-word">The head and body tags of the HTML are primarily used for organizing the document into two clear sections (the head and the body). 
                The head contains the imports to other documents, the meta tags, etc, The body contains the content that will show up on the webpage.</p>
                
                <p>In the body tag is the line <span class = "code"> &lt;script src="script.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>. This line is used for connecting our
                HTML website to a javascript file. Since we will not be doing this in this lesson, you can go ahead and delete this line.</p>
                
                <h3 id = "createHeader">Creating our heading for the Blog</h3>

                <p>So now its time to add text to our website! Yes! Lets start by adding a title. You can make your title whatever you want it to be. I'm just 
                going to call it 'My Blog'. Remeber that the text content that goes on the website should be inside the body element. </p>

                <div class = "code-block">
                    <p>&lt;body&gt;</p>
                    <p> &emsp; PUT YOUR TITLE HERE </p>
                    <p> &lt;/body&gt;</p>
                </div>

                <p>Brilliant! Lets run our HTML and see what happens!</p>
                <video autoplay muted loop>
                    <source src = "media/creatingHeader1.mov">
                </video>

                <p>I notice two things:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Stuff got on our website! Yes!</li>
                    <li>Wow does our header look small and wimpy.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Our header doesn't really seem like a header. It looks small. To fix this, we can add an h1 element. What the h1 tag does is
                 it formats your text to look larger and more heading-like. In fact, h1 stands for heading one. Lets see what our website looks like with 
                 the 'My Blog' text wrapped in a h1 tag.</p>

                <video autoplay muted loop>
                    <source src = "media/creatingHeader2.mov">
                </video>

                <p>Much better! Our heading is much larger and more heading-like.</p>
                <p>There are actually 6 tags to create headings. h1 creates the largest one, they are h1, h2, h3, h4, h5 and h6. Try playing
                around with them <a href = "https://replit.com/@KritiNegi/HeadingTags#index.html" target = "_blank">HERE</a>. Please note that you will likely have
                to fork the repository (a fancy way of saying, please copy all my files and code into a different folder). To do this click on the fork button. 
                (It should say FORK on it and have a little fork emoji that looks like a 2-pronged fork.)</p>
                
                <div class= "new-word">
                    <p class = "new-word">Here we can see the opening and closing tag structure more clearly. It looks like this (remember the syntax is 
                    <span class = "code">&lt;TagName&gt;</span> and <span class = "code">&lt;/TagName&gt;</span>): <br></p>
                    <img width = "300px" src = "./media/tagH1Diagram.png">
                    <p class ="new-word">Please note that not all HTML elements have a closing tag, as they are self closing. We will see examples of this
                    later on.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Adding a paragraph</h3>

                <p>Now its time to add a paragraph (or if you are like me, a sentence). For this we will use the paragraph tag, also called the p tag. The
                syntax looks like this: <span class = "code">&lt;p&gt; **insert whatever I want in here** &lt;p&gt;</span>. Try adding it to your blog on 
                your own.</p>

                <p>How did that go for you? (Remeber to click the 'run' button if you are on replit). Your code and website should look something like this:</p>

                <img src = "media/paraExample.png">

                <p>If you need to see the HTML up close, here it is (this only includes the HTML in the body tag, including the body tag).</p>

                <div class = "code-block">

                    <p>&lt;body&gt;</p>
                    <p>&lt;h1&gt;My Blog&lt;/h1&gt;</p>
                    <p>&lt;p&gt;Hello! Welcome to my blog. Its a blog. Here I will tell you about stuff. It will be interesting. It will be so interesting you will stop reading at this point. &lt;/p&gt;</p>
                    <p>&lt;/body&gt;</p>
                </div>

                <p>As you can see, writing blogs is not my forte.</p>

                <h3>Add an image!</h3>
                
                <p>To add an image, use the image tag. This is a self closing tag. The syntax is: <span class = "code"> &lt;img src = "image url"&gt;</span>. Looking at the image tag
                 syntax, we can see that it is a self-closing tag. We also see that to add an image to a site, we need the image url. As an example, lets say our image url is 
                 <a href = "https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2012/04/13/21/31/fish-33712_1280.png" target = "_blank">https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2012/04/13/21/31/fish-33712_1280.png.</a>, so 
                 our image tag becomes:</p>

                <div class = "code-block">
                    <p> &lt;img src = "https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2012/04/13/21/31/fish-33712_1280.png" &gt;</p>
                </div>

                <p>Try adding an image to your blog after your paragraph. Depending on the size of your image, you will notice one of three things.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Wow our image is huge.</li>
                    <li>Wow our image is small</li>
                    <li>Wow our image is just right.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>If you notice the third one, then you are very lucky. The thing is, images do not usually come out in the size we want them to. As a result, we have to add
                width and height attributes. </p>

                <p>Lets start off with an example of the width attribute in action: </p>
                <div class = "code-block">
                    <p> &lt;img width = "300px" src = "https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2012/04/13/21/31/fish-33712_1280.png" &gt;</p>
                </div>
                <p>Here we are basically setting the image width to 300px. The image will also decrease or increase in height to maintain its aspect ratio (the aspect ratio is 
                the proprotion between the height of the image and the width of the image. Its what prevents images from looking like funhouse mirrors).You will notice that I 
                did not just write "300", I added a "px". px stands for pixels.</p>

                <p class = "new-word">A pixel is a single box of color. Pixels make up images. To learn more about pixels, go 
                <a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/topics/zf2f9j6/articles/z2tgr82" >HERE</a> </p>
                
                <p>As a challenge delete the widht attribute and try to set the height to 300px using the height attribute. </p>

                <p>Here is the solution: </p>

                <div class = "code-block">
                     <p> &lt;img src = "https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/topics/zf2f9j6/articles/z2tgr82" height = "300px" &gt;</p>
                </div>
                 
                 <p>Not that 'src' is also an attribute, and the HTML will also work of you if you change the order of the attributes, in other words, if you do this: </p>

                <div class = "code-block">
                     <p> &lt;img height = "300px" src = "https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/topics/zf2f9j6/articles/z2tgr82" &gt;</p>
                </div>

                <p class = "new-word">"HTML attributes provide additional information about HTML elements." (definition taken from <a href = "https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_attributes.asp">w3schools.com</a>).
                They are found between the tagName and the closing '>' of the opening tag of the element. ( <span class = "code">&lt; tagName "INSERT ATTRIBUTES HERE!" &gt;</span>)</p>
            
                <p>As a challenge, try to finish off your blog by adding more paragraphs and images. Try messing with the heading tags to create subheadings. Maybe change the topic of the blog altogether!</p>
